This README provides an overview of the Home Loan Prediction project, which aims to automate the loan eligibility process.

# Home Loan Prediction Project

## Introduction

Dream Housing Finance Company deals in various home loans and has a presence across urban, semi-urban, and rural areas. The company wants to automate its loan eligibility process based on customer details provided in the online application form. This project focuses on building a model to identify customer segments eligible for a loan, enabling targeted marketing.

This is a standard supervised classification task where the goal is to predict whether a loan would be approved ('Y') or not ('N') based on a given set of independent variables.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can predict loan approval status in real-time based on customer application details.

## Project Structure

This project is organised into the following key sections:

1.  **Problem Statement**: Detailed understanding of the business problem.
2.  **Hypothesis Generation**: Brainstorming potential factors influencing loan approval.
3.  **Data Loading and Understanding**: Loading the datasets and examining their structure, features, and data types.
4.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
    *   Univariate Analysis: Analysing individual features.
    *   Bivariate Analysis: Exploring relationships between features.
5.  **Missing Value and Outlier Treatment**: Handling incomplete data and extreme values.
6.  **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
7.  **Model Building**: Implementing and evaluating various classification models, including:
    *   Logistic Regression
    *   Decision Tree
    *   Random Forest
    *   Random Forest with Grid Search (for hyperparameter tuning)
    *   XGBoost Classifier

## Data Description

The project uses two CSV files: `train.csv` for model training and `test.csv` for prediction.

| `Property_Area`    | Urban/Semiurban/Rural                          |
| `Loan_Status`      | Loan approved (Y/N) - **Target Variable**      |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   pandas
*   numpy
*   seaborn
*   matplotlib
*   scikit-learn
*   xgboost

### Installation

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost
```

### Usage

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone 
    cd 
    ```

2.  **Place the data files:**
    Ensure `train.csv` and `test.csv` are in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook or in a specified data folder (e.g., `../input/` as seen in the notebook).

3.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    Jupyter Notebook home-loan-prediction.ipynb
    ```

    Follow the steps outlined in the notebook to execute the data analysis, preprocessing, and model building phases.

## Hypothesis Generation (Initial Thoughts)

Before diving into the data, the following hypotheses are generated regarding factors that might influence loan approval:

*   **Salary**: Applicants with higher incomes are more likely to get loan approval.
*   **Previous History**: Applicants with a good credit history (repaid previous debts) should have higher chances of approval.
*   **Loan Amount**: Smaller loan amounts might have a higher probability of approval.
*   **Loan Term**: Loans with shorter repayment terms might be approved more readily.
*   **EMI (Equated Monthly Instalment)**: A lower EMI (relative to income) could increase the chances of loan approval.

These hypotheses will be explored and validated during the EDA phase.

## Repository Content

*   `train.csv`: Training dataset with features and the target variable (`Loan_Status`).
*   `test.csv`: Test dataset with features for which `Loan_Status` needs to be predicted.
*   `home-loan-prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.
